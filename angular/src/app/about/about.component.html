                    This is a simple startup template based on StudioX Framework and Module Zero.
                </p>

                <h3>What is StudioX Boilerplate?</h3>

                <p>
                    StudioX Boilerplate is an application framework built on latest <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> framework.
                    It makes easy to use authorization, dependency injection, validation, exception handling, localization, logging, caching, background jobs and so on.
                    It's built on already familiar tools like Entity Framework, AutoMapper, Castle Windsor...
                </p>

                <p>
                    StudioX Boilerplate implements <strong>NLayer architecture</strong> (Domain, Application, Infrastructure and Presentation Layers)
                    and <strong>Domain Driven Design</strong> (Entities, Repositories, Domain/Application Services, DTO's...).
                    Also implements and provides a good infrastructure to implement common software development <strong>best practices</strong>.
                </p>
                
                <h3>What is Module Zero?</h3>

                <p>
                    StudioX Boilerplate framework is designed to be independent of any database
                    schema and to be as generic as possible. Therefore, It leaves some concepts
                    <strong>abstract</strong> and <strong>optional</strong> (like audit logging, permission and setting stores)
                    which requires some <strong>data store</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Module Zero </strong>implements all fundamental concepts of StudioX Framework 
                    such as tenant management(<strong>multi-tenancy</strong>), role management, user management, 
                    authorization (permission management), setting management, language management, audit logging and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Module-Zero defines entities and implements <strong>domain logic</strong>
                    (domain layer) and leaves application and presentation layers to you.
                </p>

                <h4>Based on Microsoft ASP.NET Core Identity</h4>

                <p>
                    Module Zero is based on Microsoft's
                    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core Identity</a> library.
                    It extends user and role managers and implements user and role stores using generic repositories.
                </p>
